# Casumo task (Angularjs + webpack)
### By Marcos Sanz Latorre


## How to generate 1 million random items?
I develop a module to generate this task. I support Open-source so I uploaded to NPM system to allow users to download, you can find here:

```shell
npm install -g faking
```

## Let's come back to the task?

### Install
Download or clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/marsanla/ilovelists

Install global:

    sudo npm install -g gulp-cli

Install libraries:

    cd ilovelists
    npm install


Launch the dev server

    gulp serve


### Notes

* I didn't use server side, because the task wanted to focus on front-end development.
* To manage a huge list of elements in an infinite scroll, i used virtual repeater.
